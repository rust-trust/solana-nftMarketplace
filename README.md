# Solana dApp Scaffold Next

The Solana dApp Scaffold repos are meant to house good starting scaffolds for ecosystem developers to get up and running quickly with a front end client UI that integrates several common features found in dApps with some basic usage examples. Wallet Integration. State management. Components examples. Notifications. Setup recommendations.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The responsive version for wallets and wallet adapter may not function or work as expected for mobile based on plugin and wallet compatibility. For more code examples and implementations please visit the [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/)

## Installation

```bash
npm install

```

## Build and Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Features

Each Scaffold will contain at least the following features:

```
Wallet Integration with Auto Connec / Refresh

State Management

Components: One or more components demonstrating state management

Web3 Js: Examples of one or more uses of web3 js including a transaction with a connection provider

Sample navigation and page changing to demonstate state

Clean Simple Styling 

Notifications (optional): Example of using a notification system

```

A Solana Components Repo will be released in the near future to house a common components library.
